## Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chriscorbell/hyprland-tokyonight
cd hyprland-tokyonight
cp -r .config ~/
cp -r walls ~/
```
Or alternatively, I have written a script that will install my dotfiles along with a bunch of other goodies (read the script first to understand what you're installing before you run this):
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chriscorbell/hyprland-tokyonight/main/install.sh | bash
```
